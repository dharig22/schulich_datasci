    "A data analysis was performed on the experiment results in two phases. The first phase was a descriptive analysis where both Variant A and B showed an increase in Click-Through-Rate (CTR) and Time Spent in comparison to the control group. Variant A showed a 22.03% increase in CTR and a 23.59% increase in Time Spent while variant B resulted in a 10.53% increase in CTR and a 16.31% increase in Time Spent. The second phase was statistical testing, during which the t-test scores and p-values were calculated in order to determine whether the null hypothesis that there is no difference in CTR or Time Spent between the control group and the variant groups should be rejected or not. Based on both variants t-test results, there was strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. For both Variant A and B, there were statistically significant increases in CTR and Time Spent as compared to the Control Group. However, Variant A did show a larger effect size than Variant B, indicating a higher lift in both CTR and Time Spent. \n",

    "Therefore, based on the results I would recommend the engineering team to consider deploying Variant A. This variant not only led to a statistically significant increase in both key metrics of CTR and Time Spent, but also demonstrated a larger effect size compared to Variant B, meaning the improvements were more substatial perhaps. However, it is also important to consider potential impact on other parts of the product and user experience. The engineering team should ensure that this change aligns well with the overall user experience and does not negatively impact other features or functionalities."
